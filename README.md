# OpenBoard
OpenBoard is an open source cross-platform interactive white board application designed primarily for use in schools. It was originally forked from Open-Sankor√©, which was itself based on Uniboard.

Supported platforms are Windows (10+), OS X (10.13+) and Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 is the only officially maintained platform, but many others are reported by the community to work).
